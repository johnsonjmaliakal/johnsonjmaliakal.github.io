                <p>All sharks have skeletons of cartilage, have acute senses of smell and hearing, and are 
                    commonly known for being able to “smell a drop of blood in the water”, which is not entirely 
                    untrue (Ebert et al.,2021). They all also breathe with gills, like most fish, however unlike other 
                    fish, sharks must continue moving to breathe to help pump blood around their bodies. Ebert et al. 
                    (2021) adds that generally, most sharks are cold-blooded, however some are also known to be 
                    warm-blooded, such as the lamnid and thresher shark species. Shark teeth are rather distinct, and 
                    it may be possible to identify a species based on teeth alone, however for the most part sharks
                    have multiple layers of replaceable teeth below their “functional” teeth (which are being used at 
                    the time) on top, which are replaced and grown throughout their lives.</p>
